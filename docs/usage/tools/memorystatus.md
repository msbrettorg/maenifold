## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description | Example |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| *none* | - | - | MemoryStatus requires no parameters for operation | {} |

## Usage Examples

### Basic System Status Check
```json
{}
```
Returns comprehensive system statistics including file counts, storage usage, and complete database metrics.

### System Health Monitoring
```json
{}
```
Use regularly to monitor:
- Knowledge graph growth patterns
- Storage consumption trends  
- Database relationship density
- System performance indicators

### Post-Operation Validation
```json
{}
```
Run after bulk operations like:
- Large file imports or batch WriteMemory operations
- Sync operations to rebuild knowledge graph
- Database maintenance or optimization tasks
- System migrations or configuration changes

## Common Patterns

### System Health Monitoring
Use MemoryStatus as part of regular system maintenance routines. Monitor trends in concept growth, relationship density, and storage utilization to identify optimization opportunities.

### Performance Troubleshooting  
When system performance degrades, MemoryStatus provides baseline metrics to identify bottlenecks. Compare current statistics with historical data to isolate performance issues.

### Capacity Planning
Track storage growth patterns and database expansion rates. Use metrics to plan storage upgrades or implement data archival strategies before reaching capacity limits.

### Database Validation
After Sync operations or system changes, verify database integrity through concept counts and relationship metrics. Ensure expected graph structure matches actual database state.

### System Documentation
Include MemoryStatus output in system documentation, troubleshooting guides, and performance analysis reports to provide concrete baseline measurements.

## Related Tools

- **Sync**: Run after Sync to validate knowledge graph rebuilding and measure impact on system metrics
- **SearchMemories**: Use statistics to understand search performance and optimize query strategies  
- **WriteMemory**: Monitor storage growth patterns when creating large volumes of knowledge files
- **ListMemories**: Complement file system statistics with detailed directory structure analysis
- **RecentActivity**: Cross-reference system activity with health metrics for comprehensive monitoring

## System Metrics Explained

### File Statistics
- **Total files**: Count of all .md files in memory system
- **Total folders**: Directory count including nested structures
- **Total size**: Combined storage usage of all memory files in MB

### Graph Database Metrics  
- **Concepts**: Unique [[concept]] nodes extracted from memory files
- **Relations**: Connections between concepts within and across files
- **Mentions**: Total occurrences of concepts across all memory content
- **Database size**: SQLite database storage footprint in MB

### Health Indicators
- **High concept-to-file ratio**: Indicates rich knowledge interconnectivity
- **Balanced relations-to-concepts ratio**: Shows healthy graph density
- **Growing mention counts**: Demonstrates active knowledge reuse and linking

## Troubleshooting

### Database Not Initialized
**Status**: "Graph Database - Not initialized (run sync first)"  
**Cause**: SQLite database doesn't exist or is empty
**Solution**: Run Sync tool to extract concepts and build knowledge graph from existing memory files

### Zero Concepts Despite Having Files
**Status**: Files exist but zero concepts in database  
**Cause**: Files lack [[concept]] WikiLinks or Sync hasn't run
**Solution**: Add [[concepts]] to files using EditMemory, then run Sync to rebuild graph

### Large Database Size vs. Small File Count
**Status**: Database much larger than expected for file volume  
**Cause**: High relationship density or embedded vector storage
**Solution**: Normal for rich knowledge graphs; consider archival if growth excessive

### Performance Degradation with Growth
**Status**: System slowdown correlated with metric growth  
**Cause**: Database or file system performance bottlenecks
**Solution**: Analyze specific metrics to identify bottleneck (file I/O vs database queries)

### Inconsistent Metrics After Changes
**Status**: Statistics don't reflect recent operations  
**Cause**: Stale database state after bulk operations
**Solution**: Run Sync to refresh database and recalculate all metrics

## Performance Implications

### Resource Usage
MemoryStatus performs:
- File system traversal for .md files (I/O intensive for large directories)
- SQLite database queries (CPU intensive for large graphs)
- Size calculations (I/O intensive for storage metrics)

### Optimization Tips
- Run MemoryStatus during low-activity periods for large systems
- Use metrics to identify when database optimization or file reorganization needed
- Monitor trends rather than absolute values for meaningful insights

### Scalability Considerations
- Performance scales with file count and database size
- Large knowledge graphs (>10K concepts) may show slower query response
- Consider partitioning or archival strategies for very large systems

## Integration Patterns

### Automated Monitoring
Incorporate MemoryStatus into system monitoring scripts or health check routines. Set thresholds for storage usage and graph growth rates.

### Performance Analysis Workflows
Use MemoryStatus as first step in performance troubleshooting workflows. Establish baseline metrics before applying optimization strategies.

### System Documentation
Include MemoryStatus output in system status reports, capacity planning documents, and performance optimization analysis.
