# BuildContext

Explore and traverse concept relationships in your Maenifold knowledge graph through intelligent graph navigation. This tool discovers connections between [[concepts]] by analyzing co-occurrence patterns in your memory files, building contextual understanding through relationship exploration and multi-hop graph traversal.

## When to Use This Tool

- Exploring concept relationships and discovering connected ideas in your knowledge graph
- Building contextual understanding around a central concept before deep analysis
- Researching topic connections to understand conceptual neighborhoods  
- Gathering related concepts for Sequential Thinking or Workflow sessions
- Discovering knowledge patterns and concept clusters in your memory system
- Finding conceptual bridges between seemingly unrelated topics
- Preparing comprehensive context for complex problem-solving or analysis tasks

## Key Features

- **Multi-Hop Graph Traversal**: Navigate 1-hop direct relationships or extend to 2+ hops for broader context discovery
- **Co-Occurrence Analysis**: Identifies concept relationships based on shared appearances in memory files
- **Intelligent Relationship Ranking**: Orders related concepts by co-occurrence frequency and relevance
- **Source File Tracking**: Shows which memory files contain concept relationships for verification
- **Scalable Entity Control**: Configure maximum entities to focus exploration or cast wider nets
- **Concept Normalization**: Automatically handles concept name variations and formatting
- **Graph Existence Validation**: Confirms concepts exist in your knowledge graph before traversal
- **Contextual File References**: Links back to original memory files containing concept relationships

{
  "conceptName": "GraphRAG",
  "depth": 1,
  "maxEntities": 10
}
```
Explores only immediate (1-hop) relationships to GraphRAG, limiting results to 10 most relevant concepts.

### Deep Context Building
```json
{
  "conceptName": "Transformer Architecture", 
  "depth": 3,
  "maxEntities": 50
}
```
Performs deep 3-hop traversal around Transformer Architecture, returning up to 50 related concepts for comprehensive context.

### Research Preparation
```json
{
  "conceptName": "Memory Systems",
  "depth": 2,
  "maxEntities": 30,
  "includeContent": true
}
```
Builds research context around Memory Systems with 2-hop exploration, returning 30 entities with full content for detailed analysis.

## Common Patterns

### Research Context Building
Use BuildContext before starting research to understand the conceptual landscape. Discover related topics, competing approaches, and knowledge gaps in your current understanding.

### Sequential Thinking Preparation  
Build context around key concepts before Sequential Thinking sessions to prime your analysis with related ideas and connection patterns.

### Knowledge Gap Discovery
Explore concept neighborhoods to identify missing relationships or underdeveloped areas in your knowledge graph.

### Topic Bridge Finding
Use multi-hop traversal to discover conceptual bridges between different domains, revealing unexpected connections in your knowledge.

### Workflow Context Gathering
Build comprehensive context before structured workflows like design thinking or problem solving to ensure rich conceptual input.

### Concept Clustering Analysis
Analyze how concepts cluster together through co-occurrence patterns, revealing natural knowledge organization in your memory system.

## Related Tools

- **Sync**: Must run Sync before BuildContext to ensure graph contains latest concept relationships from memory files
- **SearchMemories**: Use to find specific content after BuildContext reveals related concepts
- **Visualize**: Generate Mermaid diagrams of concept relationships discovered through BuildContext exploration
- **SequentialThinking**: Use BuildContext results to prime thinking sessions with related concepts and connections
- **WriteMemory**: Create new memory files using concepts discovered through BuildContext exploration
- **ReadMemory**: Access specific memory files referenced in BuildContext source file listings

## Graph Traversal Patterns

### 1-Hop Direct Relationships
Perfect for understanding immediate concept connections and finding most relevant related ideas.
```json
{"conceptName": "Deep Learning", "depth": 1}
```

### 2-Hop Extended Context  
Ideal balance of breadth and focus, discovering concept neighborhoods while maintaining relevance.
```json
{"conceptName": "Attention Mechanism", "depth": 2}
```

### 3+ Hop Broad Exploration
Use for discovering distant relationships and finding unexpected conceptual bridges across domains.
```json
{"conceptName": "Optimization", "depth": 3, "maxEntities": 40}
```

### Focused vs. Broad Entity Limits
- **Focused (5-15 entities)**: Core relationships only, highly relevant concepts
- **Balanced (20-30 entities)**: Good coverage with manageable scope  
- **Broad (40+ entities)**: Comprehensive exploration, discovering edge relationships

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "CONCEPT 'X' not found in graph"
**Cause**: The concept doesn't exist in your knowledge graph or needs different spelling  
**Solution**: Run Sync to update graph from recent memory files, or check concept spelling and capitalization

### Error: "Run sync first"
**Cause**: Knowledge graph is empty or outdated compared to memory files  
**Solution**: Execute Sync tool to extract concepts from memory files and build/update the graph database

### No relationships found for existing concept
**Cause**: Concept exists but appears in isolation without co-occurring with other [[concepts]]  
**Solution**: Add the concept to existing memory files alongside related concepts to build relationships

### Traversal depth returns limited results
**Cause**: Your knowledge graph has sparse connections or concept clusters are isolated  
**Solution**: Increase maxEntities parameter or create memory files that bridge concept areas with shared [[concepts]]

### Performance issues with high depth/entity limits
**Cause**: Very dense concept graphs with high connectivity can create large result sets  
**Solution**: Reduce depth to 1-2 or lower maxEntities to 20-30 for faster traversal

### Missing expected concept relationships
**Cause**: Related concepts may exist in different memory files without co-occurrence  
**Solution**: Create bridging memory files that mention related concepts together to establish graph connections

## Graph Theory Foundation

BuildContext implements **LazyGraphRAG** principles through:

### Co-Occurrence Relationship Model
Concepts that appear together in the same memory file create weighted edges based on frequency of co-occurrence across multiple files.

### Breadth-First Traversal  
Explores concept relationships level by level, prioritizing closer relationships while extending to discover broader context.

### Weighted Edge Ranking
Relationships are ranked by co-occurrence count, ensuring most frequent concept pairings appear first in results.

### Source Provenance
Every relationship tracks which memory files contain the co-occurring concepts, enabling verification and deeper investigation.

## Integration with Maenifold Architecture

### Sequential Thinking Integration
Use BuildContext to gather conceptual context before thinking sessions:
```
BuildContext → SequentialThinking (with rich concept context)
```

### Workflow Preparation
Build comprehensive context before structured methodologies:
```  
BuildContext → Design Thinking Workflow (with related concepts)
```

### Knowledge Graph Evolution
As you create more memory files with [[concepts]], BuildContext discoveries become richer and more connected.

### Memory System Synergy
BuildContext reveals the structure of your knowledge while SearchMemories finds the content - complementary tools for knowledge exploration.
