## What maenifold does

**maenifold** enhances AI agents with persistent graphs of thought that compound over time.  Every tool creates `[[WikiLink]]` connections that survive conversations. Every session builds on the last. Knowledge compounds instead of resets.  **It transforms ephemeral AI sessions into continuous collective intelligence.**

</p>

[Our demo](docs/demo-artifacts/README.md) shows this at scale: 25 AI agents across 68 minutes discovered a critical production bug not through programmed coordination, but through emergent understanding. No orchestration code was written, yet agents perfectly orchestrated themselves across 4 waves, building on each other's discoveries through a shared knowledge graph.

The critical move operation bug emerged from the intersection of multiple test patterns seen across different agent sessions - something no single agent could have found alone. This is maenifold's core: making every AI session additive rather than isolated.

### How it worked:

- Agents shared discoveries through `[[WikiLinks]]` in memory files
- Each wave of agents built on previous findings via search and context traversal
- The critical bug emerged from patterns across multiple test sessions
- 171,506 new concept relationships were created, connecting discoveries
- [Full orchestration logs](docs/demo-artifacts/part1-pm-lite/orchestration-session.md) and [test results](docs/demo-artifacts/part1-pm-lite/E2E_TEST_REPORT.md) available

85% test success rate. Real production bug found. Zero orchestration code written.

That's what maenifold does: It provides the substrate (WikiLinks, memory, graph) and steps back. Intelligence fills the space.

### Reasoning Layer (Tools + Workflows) - Where Information is Processed

Where test-time computation happens:
- **Test-time Adaptive Reasoning**: Sequential thinking with revision, branching, persistence and automatic graph construction
- **Perspective Tuning**: Rich role and color (six thinking hats) definitions provide tunable agent perspectives
- **Intelligent Workflow Selection**: Meta-cognitive system that analyzes problems and selects optimal reasoning approaches
- **30 Distinct Methodologies**: Complete taxonomy from deductive reasoning to design thinking, with sophisticated orchestration
- **Assumption Ledger**: Traceable skepticism for agent reasoning—capture, validate, and track assumptions without auto-inference
- **Multi-agent Coordination**: Wave-based execution with parallel agent dispatch with 'blue-hat' product manager orchestrating sub-agents (claude-code/codex/aishell/etc...)


### Memory Layer (`memory://`) - Where Data is Stored

- **Local**: Every piece of knowledge lives as a markdown file on disk with a unique URI.
- **Transparent**: Every thought, revision, and decision visible in markdown files.
- **Human-Friendly**: All files are human-readable, Obsidian-compatible, and persist across sessions.


### Graph Layer (SQLite + vectors) - Where Knowledge Emerges

Automatic graph construction from `[[WikiLinks]]` with:
- **384-dimensional embeddings** for semantic similarity
- **Edge weights** that strengthen with repeated mentions
- **Concept clustering** revealing emergent patterns
- **Incremental sync** keeping the graph current
- **Hybrid RRF Search**: Semantic + full-text fusion for optimal retrieval (not just embedding similarity)
- **Graph Construction**: No schema, no ontology — structure emerges from WikiLink usage

## Technical Specifications

- **Language**: C# with .NET 9.0
- **Vector Dimensions**: 384 (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 via ONNX)
- **Search Algorithm**: Reciprocal Rank Fusion (k=60)
- **Database**: SQLite with vector extension
- **Graph Sync**: Incremental with file watching
- **Memory Format**: Markdown with YAML frontmatter
- **URI Scheme**: `memory://` protocol
- **Tested Scale**: > 1.1 million relationships
- **MCP Compliance**: Full tool annotation support

## Quick start

### Install
```bash
npm install -g maenifold
```

### MCP Interface

**Claude Code, Continue, Cline** - Add to MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "maenifold": {
      "command": "maenifold",
      "args": ["--mcp"],
      "env": {"MAENIFOLD_ROOT": "~/maenifold"}
    }
  }
}
```

**Codex** - Add to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.maenifold]
type = "stdio"
command = "maenifold"
args = ["--mcp"]
startup_timeout_sec = 120
tool_timeout_sec = 600
env = { MAENIFOLD_ROOT = "~/maenifold" }
```

Try it: `"Write a memory about our architecture decisions"`

### CLI Interface

Use maenifold directly in scripts, pipelines, or with non-MCP clients:

```bash
# Write a memory with WikiLinks
maenifold --tool WriteMemory --payload '{
  "title": "Architecture Decisions",
  "content": "Our [[microservices]] use [[event-sourcing]] for [[audit-trails]]"
}'

# Continue a sequential thinking session
maenifold --tool SequentialThinking --payload '{
  "sessionId": "session-1234567890",
  "response": "After analyzing the architecture...",
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true
}'

# Search memories with hybrid mode
maenifold --tool SearchMemories --payload '{
  "query": "authentication patterns",
  "mode": "Hybrid",
  "pageSize": 10
}'
```

**MCP and CLI have full feature parity.** Start a session via MCP and continue it via CLI, or vice versa. The system supports concurrent agents using the same memory location - perfect for multi-agent pipelines or parallel workflows.

## Claude Code Integration

**Automatic graph-based context restoration for every session.** The knowledge graph becomes your continuous context window.

### What it does
Every Claude Code session automatically:
- Queries recent activity from your knowledge graph
- Extracts top concepts from your work
- Builds semantic context with relationships
- Injects ~5K tokens of relevant knowledge

### Quick Setup
```bash
# Install the integration
cd ~/maenifold/docs/integrations/claude-code
./install.sh
```

This enables session continuity - every new conversation builds on all previous work through the shared knowledge graph. [Full integration guide](docs/integrations/claude-code/README.md).
