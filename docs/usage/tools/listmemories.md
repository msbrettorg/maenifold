## Usage Examples

### Root Directory Exploration
```json
{}
```
Lists the root memory directory showing all top-level folders and files, providing overview of entire knowledge system organization.

### Specific Folder Navigation
```json
{
    "path": "projects"
}
```
Explores the "projects" folder, showing all project-related subfolders and files with their metadata.

### Deep Directory Navigation
```json
{
    "path": "projects/machine-learning/experiments"
}
```
Navigates to specific nested directory to understand detailed folder structure in specialized knowledge areas.

### Research Area Exploration  
```json
{
    "path": "research"
}
```
Browses research folder to see how research notes and findings are organized before adding new content.

### Daily Notes Discovery
```json
{
    "path": "daily"
}
```
Explores daily notes structure to understand chronological organization patterns for planning new entries.

## Directory Listing Format

### Folder Display
```
### Folders
📁 projects/ (15 files)
📁 research/ (8 files)  
📁 daily/ (45 files)
📁 reference/ (3 files)
```

📄 maenifold-overview.md (8.7 KB)
📄 quick-notes.md (2.1 KB)
```

## Common Patterns

### **Pre-Write Exploration Pattern**: Check folder structure before creating new files
```json
// Step 1: Explore target folder structure
{"path": "projects"}

// Step 2: Based on structure, decide on file organization
// Step 3: Use WriteMemory with appropriate folder path
```

### **Memory System Navigation**: Progressive folder exploration
```json
// Start broad: explore root structure
{}

// Narrow focus: explore specific areas
{"path": "projects/current"}

// Deep dive: specific folder for targeted work
{"path": "projects/current/ai-research"}
```

### **Content Organization Assessment**: Understand existing structure
```json
// Check how knowledge is currently organized
{"path": "research"}

// Assess folder sizes for reorganization planning
{"path": "daily"}

// Find optimal location for new content types
```

### **File Management Planning**: Before moving or reorganizing
```json
// Understand current state before reorganization
{"path": "old-structure"}

// Plan new organization based on file distribution
{"path": "target-location"}
```

## Navigation Strategies

### **Top-Down Exploration**
1. Start with root directory (`{}`) to see overall structure
2. Identify interesting folders with high file counts
3. Navigate to specific folders for detailed exploration
4. Use findings to guide WriteMemory, SearchMemories decisions

### **Targeted Navigation**  
- Use specific paths when you know where to look
- Follow folder naming conventions discovered in exploration
- Navigate to timestamp-based folders (daily, monthly) for chronological content

### **Structure Discovery**
- Look for folder patterns that indicate knowledge organization schemes
- Identify heavily populated folders that might need subdivision
- Find sparse folders that might need consolidation

## Related Tools

- **WriteMemory**: Use ListMemories findings to choose optimal folder paths for new content
- **SearchMemories**: When ListMemories shows many files, use SearchMemories to find specific content within
- **ReadMemory**: Access specific files discovered through directory listing
- **MoveMemory**: Use directory structure insights to reorganize files between folders  
- **RecentActivity**: Combine with ListMemories to understand both content and activity patterns
- **MemoryStatus**: Get overall system statistics to complement detailed directory views

## Memory System Organization Insights

### Folder Naming Patterns
Based on directory exploration, you might discover patterns like:
- **Functional folders**: `research/`, `projects/`, `reference/`
- **Temporal folders**: `daily/`, `2024/`, `archive/`
- **Topic folders**: `ai/`, `programming/`, `philosophy/`
- **Status folders**: `active/`, `completed/`, `drafts/`

### File Distribution Analysis
Use ListMemories to identify:
- **Hotspot folders**: High file counts indicating active knowledge areas
- **Sparse areas**: Low file counts suggesting potential consolidation opportunities
- **Deep hierarchies**: Nested structures that might need flattening
- **Organization effectiveness**: Whether current structure supports knowledge discovery

## Troubleshooting

### **Error**: "Directory not found: [path]"
**Cause**: Specified path doesn't exist in memory system  
**Solution**: 
- Check path spelling and case sensitivity
- Use root exploration (`{}`) to discover correct folder names
- Remember paths are relative to memory root, not filesystem root
- Verify folder exists with parent directory listing first

### **Issue**: No folders or files shown
**Cause**: Directory exists but is empty or contains no .md files  
**Solution**:
- This is normal for empty directories
- Only .md files are shown (Maenifold knowledge files)
- Other file types are filtered out intentionally

### **Issue**: Path navigation confusion  
**Cause**: Unclear relationship between memory:// URIs and directory paths
**Solution**:
- ListMemories uses filesystem paths relative to memory root
- memory:// URIs map to these same paths (memory://projects = path: "projects")
- Forward slashes work for all path separators

### **Issue**: Large directories showing many files
**Cause**: Folder has grown to contain many knowledge files  
**Solution**:
- This indicates active knowledge area
- Consider using SearchMemories to find specific content instead of browsing
- Might indicate need for subfolder organization

### **Issue**: Difficulty finding optimal folder for new content
**Cause**: Complex directory structure unclear for content placement  
**Solution**:
- Start with root exploration to understand overall organization
- Look for similar content folders using SearchMemories
- Follow existing naming patterns discovered through exploration
- Create new folders when existing structure doesn't fit new content type

## Maenifold Integration

### Knowledge Graph Support
- Directory structure influences [[concept]] organization
- Related concepts often cluster in same folders
- Use ListMemories to understand concept locality patterns
- Folder organization can guide BuildContext exploration depth

### Memory System Navigation
ListMemories serves as the **structural overview tool** for your Maenifold:

1. **Spatial Understanding**: See where different types of knowledge live
2. **Growth Patterns**: Identify areas of active knowledge development  
3. **Organization Assessment**: Evaluate current folder structure effectiveness
4. **Content Planning**: Choose optimal locations for new knowledge creation
5. **System Health**: Monitor file distribution and identify organizational issues

### Workflow Integration
Use ListMemories as part of larger workflows:
- **Before WriteMemory**: Explore target folders to understand organization
- **With SearchMemories**: Browse structure first, then search within specific areas
- **Before MoveMemory**: Understand destination folder structure for better organization
- **With RecentActivity**: Combine structure view with activity patterns

## Ma Protocol Compliance

ListMemories follows Maenifold's Ma Protocol principles:

- **Single Responsibility**: Focused purely on directory structure exploration
- **No Magic**: Direct filesystem interaction with transparent path handling
- **Simple Parameters**: Single optional path parameter with clear defaults
- **Real Data**: Shows actual directory structure with real file counts and sizes
- **Minimal Complexity**: Static method, straightforward directory traversal
- **Memory System Focus**: Only shows .md files relevant to Maenifold knowledge

This tool provides essential **spatial navigation** within your Maenifold memory system, enabling informed decisions about content organization and knowledge structure while maintaining Ma Protocol simplicity and directness.

## Performance Characteristics

- **Fast Enumeration**: Lightweight directory and file listing operations
- **Filtered Results**: Only .md files counted and displayed for relevance
- **Minimal Memory Usage**: Streams directory contents without loading file data
- **Path Validation**: Quick existence checks before processing
- **Efficient Metadata**: File size calculation without content loading

Use ListMemories as your **memory system compass** - the essential tool for understanding where you are, where your knowledge lives, and where new content should go in your Maenifold ecosystem.
