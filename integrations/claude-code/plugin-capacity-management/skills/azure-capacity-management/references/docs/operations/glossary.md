# Glossary & FAQ

Common terminology used across the quota and capacity management guides. Each entry links to the authoritative Microsoft documentation so you're never guessing which article to cite.

## Glossary

- **Capacity and billing operations:** Unified concept for estate-level capacity planning, quota governance, capacity reservations, and Azure billing models (EA and MCA), aligned with [Well-Architected capacity planning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/performance-efficiency/capacity-planning), [workload supply chain guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/operational-excellence/workload-supply-chain), and the [FinOps Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-computing/finops/framework/). See [capacity and billing operations](capacity-and-quotas/README.md) for the full reference.
- **Capacity reservation group (CRG):** A logical container that holds one or more [on-demand capacity reservations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/capacity-reservation-overview) for specific VM sizes, regions, and zones. CRGs guarantee capacity and can be shared across subscriptions.
- **Capacity reservation:** A compute object that reserves capacity for a specific VM size in a region or availability zone, managed through a capacity reservation group, as described in the [on-demand capacity reservations overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/capacity-reservation-overview). Capacity reservations protect supply but do not change pricing on their own.
- **Azure Reservation:** A pricing construct that applies term-commitment discounts to eligible compute usage over one- or three-year terms, as described in the [FinOps rate optimization guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-computing/finops/framework/optimize/rates#getting-started) and [Azure Reservations documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/save-compute-costs-reservations). Azure Reservations reduce cost but don't guarantee capacity.
- **Azure savings plan:** A flexible pricing construct that applies discounts to eligible compute usage across services and regions over a fixed term, as described in [Azure savings plan for compute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/savings-plan/). Savings plans optimize rates but do not guarantee capacity.
- **FinOps Hubs:** Data pipeline infrastructure from the [FinOps Toolkit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-computing/finops/toolkit/hubs/finops-hubs-overview) that ingests cost and usage data into Azure Data Explorer via Data Factory. Hubs support KQL queries against normalized cost data using the [FOCUS schema](https://focus.finops.org/).
- **Quota group:** An Azure Resource Manager object created under a management group that [aggregates compute quota](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quotas/quota-groups) across eligible subscriptions, allowing transfers and group-level increase requests.
- **Logical availability zone:** Subscription-specific mapping to [physical datacenter zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview#configuring-resources-for-availability-zone-support); mappings can differ across subscriptions and must be queried via Azure Resource Manager APIs.
- **Quota alert:** An Azure Monitor alert triggered when [quota usage crosses a configured threshold](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quotas/how-to-guide-monitoring-alerting) in the **My quotas** experience.
- **Budget alert:** A Cost Management alert generated when [actual or forecasted spend exceeds defined budget thresholds](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/cost-mgt-alerts-monitor-usage-spending).
- **Deployment stamp:** A self-contained unit of infrastructure that deploys a full copy of an application along with its supporting services, following the [Deployment Stamps pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/multitenant/approaches/overview#deployment-stamps-pattern). ISVs use stamps to isolate tenants, control blast radius, and scale independently across regions and zones. Each stamp is a quota and capacity consumer.
- **MACC (Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment):** A contractual commitment to spend a minimum dollar amount on Azure over a defined period, as described in the [Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment benefit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/azure-consumption-commitment-benefit). Qualifying Azure services count toward MACC drawdown; marketplace purchases may or may not count depending on the offer.
- **Offer restriction:** A constraint on a VM series that blocks deployment in a subscription until the restriction is lifted via a support request. Offer restrictions differ from regional quota: quota limits how much you can deploy; offer restrictions prevent any deployment of the restricted SKU. Submit a [zonal enablement request](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/general/zonal-enablement-request-for-restricted-vm-series) or a [region access request](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/general/region-access-request-process) to clear an offer restriction.
- **Overallocation:** The state in which more VMs are associated with a capacity reservation group than its reserved quantity, as described in [capacity reservation overallocation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/capacity-reservation-overallocate). Overallocated VMs run without a capacity SLA and don't regain it after deallocation unless the reserved quantity is increased.
- **Scale unit:** A pre-defined, deployable increment of capacity that delivers a target service level for a specific customer or tenant count. Platform teams size scale units from load-testing and telemetry, then use scale units as the unit of demand in capacity forecasting. See [capacity planning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/performance-efficiency/capacity-planning) and [Well-Architected reliable scaling](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/reliability/scaling).
- **Subscription request:** Workflow that allows an MCA billing owner to [create a subscription for a user or service principal in another tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/create-subscription-request), requiring the recipient to accept ownership.
- **Quota:** A per-subscription limit on the number of resources (typically vCPUs per VM family) that can be deployed in a given region, managed through [per-VM quota requests](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quotas/per-vm-quota-requests) or [regional quota requests](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quotas/regional-quota-requests).
- **Management group:** An Azure Resource Manager scope above subscriptions that organizes subscriptions for [RBAC, policy, and governance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/management-groups/overview). Quota groups are created under management groups but don't inherit their policy or access controls.
- **Subscription vending:** A design pattern that standardizes how platform teams collect subscription requests, apply placement rules, and connect approvals to automation, as described in the [subscription vending design area](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-area/subscription-vending).
- **Anomaly alert:** A Cost Management alert that uses machine learning to detect [unexpected spending patterns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/cost-mgt-alerts-monitor-usage-spending) and flag deviations from historical baselines.
- **Region access:** A support workflow that unblocks a subscription in a restricted Azure region. Submit a [region access support request](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/general/region-access-request-process) when a subscription can't deploy to a specific region. Region access differs from quota: quota limits how much you can deploy; region access controls whether you can deploy at all.
- **Zonal enablement:** A support workflow that grants access to restricted VM series in specific availability zones. Submit a [zonal enablement request](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/general/zonal-enablement-request-for-restricted-vm-series) to clear the restriction.
- **FinOps:** A cloud financial management discipline that combines systems, best practices, and culture to increase an organization's ability to understand cloud costs and make informed trade-offs, as described in the [FinOps Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-computing/finops/framework/).

## FAQ

**When should we request a region access ticket instead of increasing quota?**
Quota groups and standard increases manage capacity within already-enabled regions. If the subscription cannot deploy to a specific region because access is restricted, submit a [region access support request](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/general/region-access-request-process).

**How do we recycle a subscription without losing zone enablement?**
Reclaim quota and billing ownership but keep the subscription active. Zone access flags remain in place; deleting the subscription may require repeating the [access request workflow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/general/region-access-request-process) for future projects.

**What is the difference between capacity reservations, Azure Reservations, and savings plans?**
[Capacity reservations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/capacity-reservation-overview) ensure availability of specific VM capacity in a region or availability zone through capacity reservation groups. Azure Reservations and [Azure savings plans](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/savings-plan/) provide pricing discounts over a defined term, as described in [FinOps rate optimization guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-computing/finops/framework/optimize/rates#getting-started), but they do not guarantee capacity.

**Do quota alerts and budget alerts require different permissions?**
[Quota alerts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quotas/how-to-guide-monitoring-alerting) rely on Azure Monitor alert permissions (Reader or higher on the subscription), while [budget alerts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/cost-mgt-alerts-monitor-usage-spending) follow Cost Management RBAC (Owner, Contributor, Cost Management roles). Configure both to ensure quota usage and cost trends reach the right stakeholders.
